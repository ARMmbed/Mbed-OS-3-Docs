# ARM mbed OS

Welcome to ARM mbed OS, a new operating system for ARM microcontrollers,
designed for the Internet of Things.

mbed OS is comprised of a number of software components, combined together and
built using [yotta](http://docs.yottabuild.org/). This means code lives in a
number of repositories. This repository serves as an entry point for mbed OS,
and as a central location for documentation, and for filing bugs which span
multiple components.

The code for mbed OS can be found in these repos:

* https://github.com/ARMmbed/minar
* https://github.com/ARMmbed/uvisor
* etc

We also have a number of examples to help you get started:
